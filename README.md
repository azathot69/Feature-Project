This project aims to emulate the 1st-person grid-based dungeon crawling mechanic as seen from Etrian Odyssey and Wizardry. 
The players will be able to traverse a dungeon, avoid Field-On Enemies, gather resources, and ascend to the next level.
There will also be a mini-map that shows the player's position on the map via a secondry camera that displays a second view-point that follows the player's position.
